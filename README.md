## Overview

This app is a neighborhood site checker which helps you view the map of the city Bengaluru, India and provides suggestions of places to visit. The app consists of a map with markers of suggestions and a search field to search a suggested field.

## How to run it?
To get started developing right away:

* Make sure node and npm are installed.
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Dependencies

This project uses the react framework library and its depencies. Please do an 'npm install' to download those dependencies. The app will only start once the command 'npm start' is used in the command line(cmd in windows, terminal in linux and osx). The project is compatible on all browsers.

It also uses google maps API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
